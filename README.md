# Anime Image Generation using DCGAN

This project implements a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) from scratch using PyTorch to generate anime images. The model trains on a dataset of anime pictures to generate new, realistic-looking anime characters.

# Paper

# Architecture 
It has Discrimnator and a Generator , where Discrimnator is like a offical who checks for fake and true images
Generator learns to create fake parts in turn , making a synthetic Images
